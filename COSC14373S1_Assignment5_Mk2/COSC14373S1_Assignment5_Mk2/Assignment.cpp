/*COSC 1437.3S7

PROGRAM FIVE

Using inheritance, derive two new classes from the WCS_String class:

UpperCaseString – This class will allow any characters to be stored but will store all alphabetic 
		characters as upper case.

DigitString – This class will allow only digits to be stored. Usage of other types of characters 
		will cause an exception to be thrown.

All error checking (bounds checking of indices, etc.) must be handled as exceptions (try, throw, catch). 
		Your test program must demonstrate that all exception tests.

Create all members or friend functions deemed necessary for proper functioning of your classes.


To turn in:

1) An electronic copy of the .cpp and .h files in the project folder as created by

Visual Studio. This will be emailed to the instructor with the subject line

“COSC 1437.3S7 – Lab 5”.

2) If you wish any feedback on your work, turn in a printed listing of the .cpp and

	.h files that you created.
